## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of sales records, with the goal of deriving actionable insights for business decision-making. The analysis was performed using **Microsoft Excel**, where data was cleaned, transformed, and summarized. Key findings are visualized in a dynamic dashboard to provide a clear and intuitive overview of sales performance.
